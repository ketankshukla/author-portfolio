# Book Series Creation Business — Strategy Document

## The Core Question

How do you take the skills demonstrated across 22 published books, 3 complete series, dozens of AI-generated book covers, character portraits, series branding, portfolio websites, video scripts, and children's book illustrations — and turn that into a full-time online business?

---

## Part 1: What You Actually Have

Before talking about selling, it's worth being precise about what you've built. This isn't theoretical. Every item below exists and is demonstrable:

### Writing & Series Architecture

- 3 complete book series (22 books total)
- Full series planning: multi-book arcs, cross-book continuity, chapter structure
- Non-fiction series design (Repetition, Reality) with deliberate pedagogical progression
- Fiction series design (Aztec) with 30 characters, 3 acts, 12 books, 288 chapters
- Front matter, back matter, epilogues, prologues, dedications, epigraphs — all series-specific
- Book descriptions optimised for retail (Amazon back cover copy)

### Visual Assets & AI Image Generation

- AI-generated ebook covers (photorealistic, 1600x2400, 300 DPI)
- AI-generated paperback wrap covers (full spine + back, 3878x2775, CMYK-ready)
- Character portrait generation (30 distinct characters with consistent style)
- Series logos and branding
- Landscape panoramic covers (box sets, complete series)
- YouTube thumbnails
- Children's book illustration (32-page Pixar-style picture books)
- Prompt engineering expertise for image generation (gpt-image-1.5, style headers, text overflow prevention)

### Marketing & Video

- HeyGen video scripts (3-minute cinematic trailers with scene direction, music cues, animation notes)
- 5-minute AI video scripts (book summaries for YouTube/social)
- Chapter summary scripts for verbal delivery

### Technical / Web Development

- Full portfolio websites (Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript)
- Responsive design with dark themes, custom animations, parallax effects
- Data-driven architecture (books, characters, series data in structured TypeScript)
- Deployment via GitHub + Vercel
- Custom domains and professional hosting

### The Meta-Skill

The real product isn't any single asset. It's the **complete pipeline**: concept → series plan → book content → covers → branding → portfolio website → marketing video scripts. End to end. That pipeline is what most authors and publishers don't have and can't build themselves.

---

## Part 2: Who Would Pay For This

### Tier 1 — Self-Published Authors (Largest Market)

- Authors who have written a book but have no cover, no branding, no website
- Authors planning a series who need the architecture (how many books, what arc, what structure)
- Authors who need Amazon-ready covers and descriptions
- Authors who want a professional author website but can't build one

### Tier 2 — Author Entrepreneurs / Course Creators

- Non-fiction authors who want to turn a single book into a 3-5 book series
- Course creators who want to publish companion book series
- Coaches and consultants who want to establish authority through a published series

### Tier 3 — Small Publishers & Imprints

- Indie publishers who need cover design and series branding at scale
- Publishers who need portfolio/catalogue websites
- Publishers who need marketing video scripts

### Tier 4 — Children's Book Creators

- Parents, teachers, or entrepreneurs who want custom children's picture books
- AI-illustrated children's books (concept → story → 32 illustrated pages → assembled PDF)

## Part 4: How You Show Off Your Assets

This is the critical part. Your existing work IS your marketing. Every series you've built is a case study.

### The Portfolio Approach

Your author website already showcases:

- 22 books with professional covers
- 3 complete series with distinct branding
- Character portraits (30 for Aztec)
- Series structure visualisations
- Box set designs
- Landscape panoramic covers

All you need is to **reframe the same assets as service demonstrations**. A prospect looking at the Aztec Samurai Adventures page should think: "I want that for MY series."

### Specific Showcase Strategies

**Before/After Case Studies**

- Show the journey: "This series went from a rough outline to 12 books with covers, branding, a portfolio website, and marketing videos"
- Include specific numbers: "12 books, 30 character portraits, 3 box set covers, 1 portfolio website, 3 video scripts — delivered in X weeks"

**Cover Gallery**

- A dedicated gallery page showing all covers across all series
- Filter by genre (fiction/non-fiction), style (photorealistic/illustrated), format (ebook/paperback/landscape)
- Each cover clickable to show the full series context

**Process Breakdowns**

- Blog posts or portfolio entries showing HOW the work was done
- "How I designed 12 consistent covers for a fantasy series"
- "How I planned a 5-book non-fiction series from a single topic"
- "How I created 30 character portraits with consistent style"
- These serve as both marketing AND SEO content

**Live Websites as Proof**

- aztec.ketanshukla.com
- repetition.ketanshukla.com
- reality.ketanshukla.com
- ketanshukla.com (the portfolio itself)
- Each one is a live demonstration of your web development capability

**Video Trailers**

- Once the HeyGen scripts are produced as actual videos, embed them on the site
- Video is the highest-converting content format for creative services

---

## Part 5: The Website Question

### Option A: Separate Business Website

Build a new site (e.g., bookseriesforge.com or similar) dedicated purely to the service business.

**Pros:**

- Clean separation between "author" and "service provider"
- Can be optimised purely for lead generation and conversion
- Different brand identity

**Cons:**

- Starts with zero credibility, zero SEO, zero traffic
- Duplicates effort — you'd be maintaining two sites
- Loses the most powerful asset: your actual published work as proof

### Option B: Extend ketanshukla.com (Recommended)

Add business/services sections to the existing author portfolio. The author site IS the proof. Keep everything under one roof.

**Pros:**

- Your existing work is immediately visible as portfolio evidence
- Single brand: Ketan Shukla = author + creator + service provider
- SEO compounds — blog posts, portfolio pages, and service pages all boost each other
- Prospects see the quality of your work before they even reach the services page
- One site to maintain, one GitHub repo, one deployment

**Cons:**

- Needs careful information architecture so author content and business content don't confuse each other
- Navigation needs to clearly separate "My Books" from "Services" from "Blog"

### Recommended Site Structure for ketanshukla.com

```
ketanshukla.com/
├── / (Home — hero + brief intro as author AND creator)
├── /series (Existing series showcase — Aztec, Repetition, Reality)
│   ├── /series/aztec
│   ├── /series/repetition
│   └── /series/reality
├── /services (NEW — service packages with pricing and CTAs)
│   ├── /services/book-covers
│   ├── /services/series-branding
│   ├── /services/series-planning
│   ├── /services/author-websites
│   ├── /services/video-scripts
│   └── /services/childrens-books
├── /portfolio (NEW — gallery of all visual work, case studies)
│   ├── /portfolio/covers
│   ├── /portfolio/characters
│   ├── /portfolio/websites
│   └── /portfolio/case-studies
├── /blog (NEW — process posts, tips, behind-the-scenes, SEO content)
├── /about (Author bio, expanded with professional credentials)
├── /contact (NEW — inquiry form for services)
└── /testimonials (NEW — as you get clients)
```

### Why This Works

A prospect arrives at ketanshukla.com. They see:

1. A professional, modern website (proof you can build them)
2. 22 published books with stunning covers (proof you can design them)
3. 3 complete series with cohesive branding (proof you can plan them)
4. 30 character portraits (proof you can create them)
5. Video trailers (proof you can script them)
6. A services page that says: "I can do all of this for you"

The entire site IS the sales pitch. Every page is a demonstration. That is dramatically more powerful than a standalone business site with stock photos and generic copy.

---

## Part 6: Marketing Channels

### Organic / SEO (Long-term, highest ROI)

- Blog posts: "How to plan a book series," "AI book cover design process," "Author website best practices"
- Each post targets a specific keyword that self-published authors search for
- Your existing series pages will rank for series-related terms
- Process breakdowns and tutorials establish authority

### Social Media

- **Twitter/X:** Share covers, process threads, behind-the-scenes
- **Instagram:** Cover gallery, character portraits, before/after reveals
- **YouTube:** Turn HeyGen scripts into actual videos. Behind-the-scenes content. Series planning walkthroughs
- **TikTok:** Short-form cover reveals, "watch me design a book cover in 60 seconds"
- **Reddit:** r/selfpublish, r/writing, r/bookcovers — provide genuine value, not spam

### Direct Outreach

- Self-publishing Facebook groups (massive market)
- Writing communities (NaNoWriMo, Scribophile, etc.)
- Fiverr/Upwork initially to build reviews and client base
- Author conferences and events (virtual and in-person)

### Email List

- Offer a free resource (e.g., "Series Planning Template" or "Book Cover Checklist") in exchange for email
- Nurture with process content and case studies
- Convert with service offers

---

## Part 7: Pricing Philosophy

### Don't Compete on Price

The market is full of cheap Fiverr covers ($20–$50) that look generic. Your differentiator is not price — it's the **complete pipeline and the quality of the output**. Position yourself as premium.

### Value-Based Pricing

- A single book cover might sell for $200, but if it makes the author's book look professional enough to convert browsers into buyers, the ROI for them is massive
- A complete series launch package at $5,000 is a fraction of what a traditional publisher would spend — and the author keeps all their rights
- An author website at $2,000 replaces a $200/month WordPress maintenance contract within 10 months

### Start with Portfolio-Building Rates

- First 5–10 clients: offer reduced rates in exchange for testimonials and permission to showcase the work
- Build the case study library
- Then move to full pricing

---

## Part 8: Immediate Next Steps

1. **Decide on site structure** — extend ketanshukla.com with services/portfolio/blog sections
2. **Create 3 case studies** from your existing series (Aztec, Repetition, Reality)
3. **Write 3 blog posts** demonstrating your process (cover design, series planning, website building)
4. **Set up a contact/inquiry form** with fields for project type and budget
5. **Create a services page** with clear packages and pricing (or "starting from" pricing)
6. **Produce the HeyGen videos** from the scripts you already have — embed on site
7. **List on Fiverr/Upwork** for initial client acquisition and reviews
8. **Start posting process content** on social media (covers, portraits, before/after)
9. **Build an email opt-in** with a free series planning template

---

## Part 9: What Makes This Business Defensible

The AI tools are available to everyone. What's NOT available to everyone is:

1. **The taste and judgment** to use them well — knowing what makes a good cover, a good series structure, a good website
2. **The complete pipeline** — most people can do one thing. You can do all of it, end to end
3. **The proof** — 22 published books, 3 live portfolio websites, dozens of professional covers. This is not a pitch deck. This is a track record.
4. **The systems** — prompt engineering, style headers, generation scripts, assembly pipelines. These are production systems, not experiments
5. **The speed** — because you've built the pipeline, you can deliver faster than someone figuring it out for the first time

That combination — taste + pipeline + proof + systems + speed — is the moat.

---

## Part 10: Updates & Revision Pricing

When a client comes back and asks for changes to work you've already delivered, that's billable work. Here's how to price updates and revisions for each package.

### Package 1: Book Cover Design

| Update Type                                                  | Price                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Minor tweaks (text fix, color adjustment, subtitle change)   | $25–$50 per revision |
| Major rework (new concept, different style, layout overhaul) | $75–$150             |
| Format conversion (e.g., ebook cover → paperback wrap)       | $50–$100             |

**Policy:** Include 1–2 rounds of minor revisions in the original price. Anything beyond that is billed separately. A "minor" revision is a text or color tweak. A "major" revision is a new concept or layout — essentially a new cover at a returning client discount.

### Package 2: Series Branding

| Update Type                                                              | Price                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New book cover matching existing series branding                         | $100–$250 per book (discounted from standalone — style guide already exists) |
| Logo or branding refresh                                                 | $150–$300                                                                    |
| New box set or panoramic cover for additional volumes                    | $100–$200                                                                    |
| Series Expansion retainer (ongoing cover additions as new books publish) | $200–$400/quarter                                                            |

**Policy:** Once the series visual identity is established, adding new books to it is faster because the style system already exists. Price accordingly — cheaper than a standalone cover, but still meaningful because consistency requires care.

### Package 3: Series Architecture & Planning

| Update Type                                                                                   | Price                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Adding books to an existing series plan (new outlines, chapter structure, continuity updates) | $100–$300 per book      |
| Restructuring an existing plan (reordering books, splitting/merging, arc changes)             | $200–$500               |
| Updated book descriptions for Amazon (e.g., after a rebrand or new edition)                   | $30–$50 per description |

**Policy:** This is the stickiest service. Once you've built a client's series architecture, they will come back to you for every expansion. Lean into this — it's long-term recurring work.

### Package 4: Author Portfolio Website

| Update Type                                                        | Price                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Content updates (adding a new book, updating bio, swapping covers) | $50–$100 per update, or $150–$300/month maintenance retainer |
| New page or section (e.g., new series page, events page)           | $200–$500                                                    |
| Design refresh (new theme, layout overhaul, new animations)        | $500–$1,500                                                  |
| Bug fixes / hosting issues (after 30-day free support window)      | $75–$150/hour                                                |

**Policy:** Push the maintenance retainer model. Authors publish new books regularly and will need the site updated. A $200/month retainer for unlimited minor updates is attractive to clients and gives you predictable recurring revenue. Include 30 days of free post-launch support in the original price.

### Package 5: Marketing Video Scripts

| Update Type                                                                      | Price                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Script revision (new narration, updated scene direction)                         | $75–$150                                    |
| New script for a new book in the same series (reusing established tone/style)    | $150–$350 (slight discount from standalone) |
| Adapting script to a different format (e.g., 3-min trailer → 60-sec social clip) | $50–$100                                    |

**Policy:** Bundle with cover design. When a client publishes a new book, offer a "New Book Launch Pack" (cover + script) at a combined rate — this increases average order value.

### Package 6: Children's Picture Book

| Update Type                                    | Price                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text/story edits with re-illustrated pages     | $30–$75 per page                                                  |
| Adding new pages to an existing book           | $50–$100 per new illustrated page                                 |
| New character or scene in existing style       | $75–$150                                                          |
| Full sequel book (same characters, same style) | $600–$2,000 (discounted — character design system already exists) |

**Policy:** Character consistency is the hard part. Once it's nailed for book 1, sequels are faster to produce. Price sequels lower than the original, but don't undervalue the work — maintaining consistency across a full book still requires significant effort.

### Package 7: Full Pipeline / Premium

| Update Type                                                                              | Price                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Ongoing retainer (website maintenance + new covers + updated descriptions + new scripts) | $500–$1,500/month    |
| Per-book expansion (cover + description + website update + script for each new book)     | $500–$1,000 per book |
| Annual refresh (new covers, website redesign, updated branding)                          | $1,000–$2,500        |

**Policy:** This is your highest-value client. Lock them into an annual retainer. They are outsourcing their entire publishing production pipeline to you — price it as the premium, irreplaceable service it is.

### General Revision Policy

1. **Always include 1–2 revision rounds in the base price** — this builds trust and avoids nickel-and-diming on the initial delivery
2. **Define "minor" vs "major" clearly in your contract** — minor = text/color tweaks; major = new concept/layout/structure
3. **Retainers over one-off charges** — recurring revenue is the goal. Website maintenance and series expansion retainers are the most natural fits
4. **Returning client discount** — offer 10–15% off for repeat clients. They're already sold on your quality; make it easy and rewarding to come back
5. **Rush fees** — charge 25–50% extra for turnarounds under 48 hours. Your time and pipeline efficiency have value
6. **Scope creep protection** — always agree on the scope of an update in writing before starting. "Can you just..." requests are the biggest source of unpaid work

---

## Part 11: Stripe Storefront — Pay Before Work Begins

The goal is simple: every service, update, and revision is a purchasable item on your website. The client picks what they need, pays through Stripe, and only then does work begin. No invoicing back-and-forth, no chasing payments, no scope ambiguity. They buy a defined product, you deliver it.

### Yes, Stripe Supports This

Stripe offers several features that make this possible:

1. **Stripe Products & Prices** — You create each service as a "product" in your Stripe dashboard with a fixed price. Each product gets a unique ID.
2. **Stripe Payment Links** — For each product, Stripe generates a shareable payment link. Client clicks it, enters card details, pays. Done. No code required for this — you can literally paste links onto your website.
3. **Stripe Checkout (embedded)** — For a more polished experience, you embed Stripe Checkout directly into your Next.js website. Client clicks "Buy" on your services page, gets a Stripe checkout form without leaving your site.
4. **Stripe Customer Portal** — Clients can manage their own subscriptions and payment methods (useful for retainer packages).
5. **Stripe Recurring Billing** — For retainers and maintenance plans, Stripe handles automatic monthly/quarterly billing.

### How It Works on Your Website

```
ketanshukla.com/services
├── /services/book-covers         → lists all cover-related products
├── /services/series-branding     → lists all branding-related products
├── /services/series-planning     → lists all planning-related products
├── /services/author-websites     → lists all website-related products

├── /services/full-pipeline       → lists premium/bundle products
└── /services/updates-revisions   → lists all update/revision products
```

Each page shows the available products as cards with a description, price, and a "Buy Now" button. The button triggers Stripe Checkout. After payment, the client receives a confirmation email and you receive a Stripe notification to begin work.

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Stripe Payment Links (Immediate — No Code)

1. Create a Stripe account (free — Stripe charges 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction, no monthly fees)
2. Add every product from the catalogue above into the Stripe dashboard
3. Generate a Payment Link for each product
4. Add "Buy Now" buttons to your services pages that link to these Payment Links
5. This works TODAY with zero code changes to your website

#### Phase 2: Embedded Stripe Checkout (Better UX)

1. Install `@stripe/stripe-js` in your Next.js project
2. Create API routes that generate Stripe Checkout Sessions
3. Replace Payment Link buttons with embedded checkout — client stays on your site
4. Add success/cancel pages that confirm the order
5. This gives a more professional, seamless experience

#### Phase 3: Client Dashboard (Advanced)

1. Add Stripe Customer Portal so clients can view their orders and manage subscriptions
2. Build a simple order status page on your site (paid → in progress → delivered)
3. Automated email confirmations with estimated delivery timelines
4. This turns your site into a full self-service platform

### Why This Model Works

1. **No unpaid work** — payment is collected before any work begins. No invoicing, no "I'll pay you when it's done," no ghosting after delivery
2. **Clear scope** — the client bought a specific, defined product. There is no ambiguity about what they're getting
3. **Professional appearance** — a Stripe checkout page looks like a real business, not a freelancer asking for a bank transfer
4. **Instant trust** — Stripe is a recognised, trusted payment processor. Clients feel safe entering their card details
5. **Automatic records** — Stripe provides receipts, invoices, and tax records for both you and the client
6. **Scalable** — whether you have 1 client or 100, the system works the same way. No manual invoicing
7. **Recurring revenue** — retainers and subscriptions are billed automatically. You don't have to chase monthly payments
8. **Stripe fees are reasonable** — 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction. On a $2,000 website order, that's $58.30. The convenience and professionalism are worth far more than that

### What the Client Experience Looks Like

1. Client visits ketanshukla.com and browses your portfolio (sees proof of quality)
2. Client goes to /services and finds the package they need
3. Client clicks "Buy Now" on the specific product
4. Stripe Checkout opens — client enters name, email, card details
5. Payment is processed immediately
6. Client receives a confirmation email with order details and estimated delivery timeline
7. You receive a Stripe notification and begin work
8. For revisions/updates: client returns to /services/updates-revisions, purchases the specific update they need, same flow

No phone calls. No back-and-forth emails about pricing. No "can you send me an invoice." The price is on the page, the checkout is one click, and work begins after payment. Clean and professional.

## Part 12: Testing with Stripe Test Mode

Stripe has a fully functional **Test Mode** built in. It simulates the entire payment flow — products, checkout, payments, subscriptions, emails, webhooks — without processing any real money. You can test everything end to end before going live.

### How Stripe Test Mode Works

Every Stripe account has two modes:

- **Test Mode** — fake money, fake cards, fake transactions. Nothing is real. Toggle it on from the Stripe dashboard.
- **Live Mode** — real money, real cards, real transactions. Only switch to this when you're ready.

Both modes are completely separate. Test products, test customers, and test payments never touch your real account. You can test as many times as you want with zero risk.

### Step-by-Step: Testing the Full Flow

#### Step 1: Enable Test Mode

1. Log into your Stripe dashboard at dashboard.stripe.com
2. In the top-right corner, toggle the switch to **"Test mode"** (it turns orange)
3. Everything you do from this point is simulated

#### Step 2: Create Test Products

1. Go to **Products** in the Stripe dashboard (still in test mode)
2. Click **"Add product"**
3. Create a few products from the Part 11 catalogue to test with, for example:
   - "Ebook Cover Design" — $150, one-time
   - "Website Maintenance — Basic" — $150/month, recurring
   - "Full Pipeline — Standard" — $5,000, one-time
4. Each product gets a test Price ID (starts with `price_test_...`)

#### Step 3: Generate Test Payment Links

1. For each test product, click **"Create payment link"**
2. Stripe generates a URL like `https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123`
3. Open that link in your browser — you'll see the real checkout page, but in test mode

#### Step 4: Use Test Card Numbers

Stripe provides fake card numbers that simulate different scenarios. No real money is charged.

| Card Number           | What It Simulates                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Successful payment                                     |
| `4000 0000 0000 3220` | 3D Secure authentication required (prompts extra step) |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | Payment declined — insufficient funds                  |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Payment declined — generic decline                     |
| `4000 0000 0000 0069` | Payment declined — expired card                        |
| `4000 0000 0000 0127` | Payment declined — incorrect CVC                       |

For all test cards:

- **Expiry date:** any future date (e.g., 12/34)
- **CVC:** any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
- **ZIP/postcode:** any valid format (e.g., 12345)

#### Step 5: Complete a Test Purchase

1. Open a test Payment Link
2. Enter any name and email (use your own email to see the confirmation)
3. Enter test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`, expiry `12/34`, CVC `123`
4. Click "Pay"
5. Payment succeeds — you'll see the success page
6. Check your email — you'll receive a Stripe receipt (marked as test)
7. Check your Stripe dashboard — the payment appears under **Payments** (in test mode)

#### Step 6: Test a Subscription

1. Create a test product with recurring pricing (e.g., "Website Maintenance — Basic" at $150/month)
2. Generate a Payment Link for it
3. Complete the purchase with a test card
4. In your Stripe dashboard, go to **Subscriptions** — you'll see the active test subscription
5. You can simulate the next billing cycle, cancellations, and failed payments from the dashboard

#### Step 7: Test Webhooks (For Embedded Checkout)

If you later build the embedded Stripe Checkout in your Next.js site (Phase 2 from Part 11), you'll want to test webhooks — these are notifications Stripe sends to your server when events happen (payment succeeded, subscription cancelled, etc.).

1. Install the Stripe CLI: `stripe login` from your terminal
2. Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. This forwards test webhook events to your local development server
4. Make a test purchase — your server receives the event in real time
5. You can also trigger test events manually: `stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded`

### What You Can Test in Test Mode

| Scenario                                  | How to Test It                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client buys a one-time package            | Create product → Payment Link → test card `4242...`                       |
| Client buys a subscription/retainer       | Create recurring product → Payment Link → test card                       |
| Payment is declined                       | Use decline test card `4000 0000 0000 9995`                               |
| Client's card requires extra verification | Use 3D Secure test card `4000 0000 0000 3220`                             |
| Subscription renewal                      | Dashboard → Subscriptions → advance clock to next billing date            |
| Client cancels subscription               | Dashboard → Subscriptions → cancel the test subscription                  |
| Refund a payment                          | Dashboard → Payments → select payment → issue refund                      |
| Client receives confirmation email        | Use your real email as the test customer — Stripe sends a test receipt    |
| You receive payment notification          | Check the Stripe dashboard → Payments, or set up email notifications      |
| Webhook fires when payment succeeds       | Stripe CLI → `stripe listen` → make test purchase → see event in terminal |

### Test Mode vs Live Mode — The Switch

When you're satisfied that everything works:

1. Go to the Stripe dashboard and toggle **off** test mode (switch back to the default live view)
2. Create the same products in live mode (or use the Stripe API to copy them)
3. Replace test Payment Links with live Payment Links on your website
4. If using embedded checkout, swap the test API keys for live API keys:
   - Test key: `pk_test_...` → Live key: `pk_live_...`
   - Test secret: `sk_test_...` → Live secret: `sk_live_...`
5. Make one real small purchase yourself (e.g., $1 test product) to confirm live mode works
6. Refund yourself immediately
7. You're live

### Key Points

- **Test mode is free and unlimited** — test as many times as you want, no charges, no fees
- **Test and live are completely separate** — test data never appears in live mode and vice versa
- **Test emails look real** — they arrive in your inbox with full formatting, just marked as "test"
- **No real money ever moves in test mode** — even if you enter a real card number by accident, Stripe won't charge it in test mode
- **You can stay in test mode for as long as you need** — there is no deadline to go live

## Part 13: GitHub & Vercel for Client Projects — Scaling Your Workflow

Your current workflow — build in Next.js, push to GitHub, Vercel deploys automatically — is exactly the right approach for a business. You do NOT need WordPress. You do NOT need to change your tech stack. What changes is how you **organise accounts, repos, and billing** so that your personal projects and client projects don't get tangled up.

### Your Current Setup

- **GitHub:** Personal account (ketankshukla) with repos for your own sites
- **Vercel:** Personal account connected to your GitHub, auto-deploys on push
- **Sites:** ketanshukla.com, aztec.ketanshukla.com, repetition.ketanshukla.com, reality.ketanshukla.com
- **Domains:** Managed through your own accounts
- **Cost:** GitHub free tier, Vercel free/hobby tier

This works perfectly for your own projects. For client projects, you need to decide who owns what.

### The Core Question: Who Owns the Client's Site?

There are two models. Both work. The right choice depends on whether you want to hand off the project completely or maintain an ongoing relationship.

#### Model A: Client Owns Everything (Build & Hand Off)

You build the site, then transfer ownership to the client. They own the repo, the Vercel project, and the domain. You walk away after delivery (unless they buy updates from your Stripe store).

**How it works:**

1. Create a new GitHub repo under YOUR account during development (e.g., `ketankshukla/client-jane-author-site`)
2. Build the site, push to GitHub, deploy on YOUR Vercel for development/preview
3. When the site is finished and paid for, **transfer the repo** to the client's GitHub account (or create one for them)
4. Client connects their own Vercel account (free hobby tier) to their repo
5. Point their custom domain to their Vercel deployment
6. Done — they own everything. If they want updates later, they buy from your Stripe store and you get temporary access

**Pros:**

- Clean separation — client's site is not on your accounts
- No ongoing hosting responsibility or cost for you
- Client has full ownership (some clients insist on this)

**Cons:**

- Client needs a GitHub account and a Vercel account (you may need to set these up for them)
- If they break something, it's their problem unless they pay for support
- You lose the ongoing relationship unless they come back for updates

**Best for:** One-time website builds where the client wants full control

#### Model B: You Own & Manage Everything (Recommended for Recurring Revenue)

You keep the repo and the Vercel project on YOUR accounts. The client pays you for hosting and maintenance. They get a live website with their custom domain, but you control the infrastructure.

**How it works:**

1. Create a GitHub repo under your account (e.g., `ketankshukla/client-jane-author-site`)
2. Build the site, deploy on your Vercel account
3. Add the client's custom domain to the Vercel project
4. Client's site is live at their domain (e.g., janesmith-author.com)
5. Client pays a monthly maintenance retainer (from your Stripe store) that covers hosting management + updates
6. When they need changes, they buy the specific update from your Stripe store, you push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys

**Pros:**

- Recurring revenue — every client site is a monthly retainer
- You maintain full control — no risk of the client breaking their own site
- Simpler for the client — they don't need to know what GitHub or Vercel is
- You can update all client sites from one place
- Professional service model — similar to how agencies operate

**Cons:**

- You're responsible for uptime and hosting
- Your Vercel account needs to handle more projects (may need a paid plan)
- If you disappear, the client's site is stuck on your account

**Best for:** Ongoing client relationships, maintenance retainers, maximum recurring revenue

### Recommended: Model B with a Business GitHub Organisation

The cleanest approach is to create a **GitHub Organisation** for your business and upgrade your Vercel to a **Team/Pro plan** when you have enough clients to justify it.

### GitHub Structure

```
GitHub Personal Account: ketankshukla
├── author-portfolio          (your personal site — ketanshukla.com)
├── aztec-portfolio           (aztec.ketanshukla.com)
├── repetition-portfolio      (repetition.ketanshukla.com)
└── reality-portfolio         (reality.ketanshukla.com)

GitHub Organisation: ketanshukla-studio (or whatever business name you choose)
├── client-jane-smith         (janesmith-author.com)
├── client-mark-johnson       (markjohnsonbooks.com)
├── client-sunrise-publishing (sunrisepublishing.com)
└── client-templates          (reusable starter templates)
```

**Why an Organisation?**

- Free to create on GitHub
- Keeps client repos completely separate from your personal repos
- You can add collaborators later if you ever hire help
- Looks professional — clients can see their repo under a business name, not your personal account
- All client repos are in one place, easy to manage

**How to create it:**

1. Go to github.com → Settings → Organisations → New Organisation
2. Choose the free plan (unlimited public/private repos)
3. Name it something professional (your business name)
4. Create client repos under this organisation

### Vercel Structure

**Important:** Vercel's Hobby plan **does not allow commercial use**. Once you're deploying client sites and charging for them, you need to be on the **Pro plan ($20/month)**. This is non-negotiable per Vercel's terms of service.

**When to upgrade:**

- Upgrade to Vercel Pro when you land your first paying client whose site you're hosting
- $20/month is trivially covered by even a single $150/month maintenance retainer
- Connect the Vercel Team to your GitHub Organisation — auto-deploy works the same way

### Domain Management for Client Sites

Each client will have their own custom domain. Here's how to handle it:

#### Option A: Client Buys Their Own Domain (Recommended)

1. Client purchases their domain from a registrar (Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare, etc.)
2. You add the domain to the Vercel project
3. Vercel gives you DNS records (A record, CNAME)
4. Client updates their domain's DNS settings to point to Vercel (or you do it for them if they give you access)
5. SSL certificate is automatic — Vercel handles it

**Why this is better:** The client owns their domain. If they ever leave, their domain goes with them. No disputes.

#### Option B: You Buy the Domain on Their Behalf

1. You purchase the domain and charge the client for it (include it in the project cost or bill annually)
2. You manage DNS and point it to Vercel
3. If the client leaves, you transfer the domain to them

**Why this is riskier:** Domain ownership disputes are messy. Avoid this unless the client specifically asks you to handle it.

### The Complete Client Project Workflow

Here's exactly what happens from payment to live site:

```
1. Client buys "Author Portfolio Website — Standard" ($2,000) from your Stripe store
2. You receive Stripe notification + payment confirmation
3. You create a new repo: github.com/ketanshukla-studio/client-[name]
4. You scaffold the Next.js project using your starter template
5. You build the site (books, covers, bio, series — using assets the client provides)
6. You push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys to a preview URL
7. You send the client the preview URL for review
8. Client requests revisions (included — 1-2 rounds in the base price)
9. You make changes, push again → Vercel auto-deploys updated preview
10. Client approves
11. Client's custom domain is pointed to the Vercel project
12. Site is live
13. Client optionally subscribes to "Website Maintenance — Basic" ($150/month) via Stripe
14. Future updates: client buys specific update product from Stripe store → you push changes → Vercel auto-deploys
```

This is exactly the same workflow you use today for your own sites — just with a client on the other end and a payment step at the beginning.

### Starter Template Strategy

You should create a **reusable Next.js starter template** based on your existing portfolio sites. This dramatically speeds up client project delivery.

```
ketanshukla-studio/author-site-template
├── Pre-built components: book showcase, series page, character gallery, author bio
├── TailwindCSS dark theme (your signature style)
├── TypeScript data structure for books, series, characters
├── Responsive design, animations, parallax effects
├── Vercel deployment config
├── README with setup instructions
```

For each new client:

1. Clone the template
2. Swap in their data (books, covers, bio)
3. Customise colors, fonts, layout as needed
4. Deploy

What currently takes you days to build from scratch could take hours with a solid template. The template IS the product — the customisation is the service.

### Cost Summary for Running Client Sites

| Item                           | Cost                       | When                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| GitHub Organisation            | Free                       | Now                              |
| Vercel Pro plan                | $20/month                  | When first client site goes live |
| Stripe fees                    | 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction | Per payment received             |
| Domain (if you buy for client) | $10–$15/year per domain    | Per client, annually             |
| Your time                      | Your biggest cost          | Per project                      |

**Break-even:** A single client on a $150/month maintenance retainer covers your Vercel Pro cost and Stripe fees with plenty left over. By client #3 or #4, the infrastructure costs are negligible compared to revenue.

### What NOT to Change

- **Do NOT switch to WordPress** — your Next.js + Vercel stack is faster, more professional, and more maintainable
- **Do NOT use shared hosting** — Vercel's edge network is better than any shared hosting provider
- **Do NOT build client sites on your personal GitHub** — use an Organisation to keep things clean
- **Do NOT host client sites on your personal Vercel Hobby plan** — commercial use requires Pro
- **Do NOT give clients direct access to the repo** unless they specifically want Model A (full handoff)

### The Bottom Line on Stripe Fees

- Stripe takes roughly **3%** of every transaction
- On a $100 sale, you lose $3.20 — you keep $96.80
- On a $1,000 sale, you lose $29.30 — you keep $970.70
- On a $5,000 sale, you lose $145.30 — you keep $4,854.70
- On a $150/month retainer, you lose $55.80/year — you keep $1,744.20/year
- The fees are the cost of having a professional, trusted, instant payment system. No invoicing, no chasing payments, no bounced checks. It's worth it.

### Why This Focus Works

1. **Images are your strongest skill** — ebook covers, series branding, children's book illustrations. This is where your portfolio proof is most impressive.
2. **Series planning is your unique differentiator** — most cover designers can't plan a series. Most series planners can't design covers. You do both.
3. **Children's books are a standalone niche** — different audience, different marketing, high-value product. Worth keeping from day one.
4. **No infrastructure overhead** — no Vercel Pro plan needed, no hosting management, no ongoing maintenance responsibility. You deliver files, not services that require uptime.
5. **Websites and video scripts can be added later** — once you have steady cover/branding income, expanding into websites and scripts is a natural next step.

### When to Expand Beyond Starter

Add the next service tier when:

| Trigger                                                                   | What to Add                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You have 5+ cover/branding clients and feel comfortable with the workflow | Paperback wrap covers ($250 each)                                               |
| A client asks for a website and you have bandwidth                        | Author portfolio websites ($1,000–$3,000). Upgrade to Vercel Pro at this point. |
| You have video script examples ready to show                              | Marketing video scripts ($100–$300)                                             |

Don't add services because they seem like a good idea. Add them because a client is asking and willing to pay.

## Summary

- **Sell the complete pipeline**, not individual assets
- **Use your existing work as proof** — it's the most powerful marketing you have
- **Extend ketanshukla.com** rather than building a separate site — the author portfolio IS the business portfolio
- **Add services, portfolio gallery, blog, and contact sections** to the existing site
- **Price premium**, not cheap — your differentiator is quality and completeness
- **Market through content** — blog posts, social media, and video that demonstrate your process
- **Start with portfolio-building clients** to get testimonials, then scale pricing

The foundation is already built. The next step is to restructure the website to serve both purposes — author showcase AND service business — and start putting the work in front of the people who need it.
