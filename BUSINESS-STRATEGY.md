# Book Series Creation Business — Strategy Document

## The Core Question

How do you take the skills demonstrated across 22 published books, 3 complete series, dozens of AI-generated book covers, character portraits, series branding, portfolio websites, video scripts, and children's book illustrations — and turn that into a full-time online business?

---

## Part 1: What You Actually Have

Before talking about selling, it's worth being precise about what you've built. This isn't theoretical. Every item below exists and is demonstrable:

### Writing & Series Architecture

- 3 complete book series (22 books total)
- Full series planning: multi-book arcs, cross-book continuity, chapter structure
- Non-fiction series design (Repetition, Reality) with deliberate pedagogical progression
- Fiction series design (Aztec) with 30 characters, 3 acts, 12 books, 288 chapters
- Front matter, back matter, epilogues, prologues, dedications, epigraphs — all series-specific
- Book descriptions optimised for retail (Amazon back cover copy)

### Visual Assets & AI Image Generation

- AI-generated ebook covers (photorealistic, 1600x2400, 300 DPI)
- AI-generated paperback wrap covers (full spine + back, 3878x2775, CMYK-ready)
- Character portrait generation (30 distinct characters with consistent style)
- Series logos and branding
- Landscape panoramic covers (box sets, complete series)
- YouTube thumbnails
- Children's book illustration (32-page Pixar-style picture books)
- Prompt engineering expertise for image generation (gpt-image-1.5, style headers, text overflow prevention)

### Marketing & Video

- HeyGen video scripts (3-minute cinematic trailers with scene direction, music cues, animation notes)
- 5-minute AI video scripts (book summaries for YouTube/social)
- Chapter summary scripts for verbal delivery

### Technical / Web Development

- Full portfolio websites (Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript)
- Responsive design with dark themes, custom animations, parallax effects
- Data-driven architecture (books, characters, series data in structured TypeScript)
- Deployment via GitHub + Vercel
- Custom domains and professional hosting

### The Meta-Skill

The real product isn't any single asset. It's the **complete pipeline**: concept → series plan → book content → covers → branding → portfolio website → marketing video scripts. End to end. That pipeline is what most authors and publishers don't have and can't build themselves.

---

## Part 2: Who Would Pay For This

### Tier 1 — Self-Published Authors (Largest Market)

- Authors who have written a book but have no cover, no branding, no website
- Authors planning a series who need the architecture (how many books, what arc, what structure)
- Authors who need Amazon-ready covers and descriptions
- Authors who want a professional author website but can't build one

### Tier 2 — Author Entrepreneurs / Course Creators

- Non-fiction authors who want to turn a single book into a 3-5 book series
- Course creators who want to publish companion book series
- Coaches and consultants who want to establish authority through a published series

### Tier 3 — Small Publishers & Imprints

- Indie publishers who need cover design and series branding at scale
- Publishers who need portfolio/catalogue websites
- Publishers who need marketing video scripts

### Tier 4 — Children's Book Creators

- Parents, teachers, or entrepreneurs who want custom children's picture books
- AI-illustrated children's books (concept → story → 32 illustrated pages → assembled PDF)

---

## Part 4: How You Show Off Your Assets

This is the critical part. Your existing work IS your marketing. Every series you've built is a case study.

### The Portfolio Approach

Your author website already showcases:

- 22 books with professional covers
- 3 complete series with distinct branding
- Character portraits (30 for Aztec)
- Series structure visualisations
- Box set designs
- Landscape panoramic covers

All you need is to **reframe the same assets as service demonstrations**. A prospect looking at the Aztec Samurai Adventures page should think: "I want that for MY series."

### Specific Showcase Strategies

**Before/After Case Studies**

- Show the journey: "This series went from a rough outline to 12 books with covers, branding, a portfolio website, and marketing videos"
- Include specific numbers: "12 books, 30 character portraits, 3 box set covers, 1 portfolio website, 3 video scripts — delivered in X weeks"

**Cover Gallery**

- A dedicated gallery page showing all covers across all series
- Filter by genre (fiction/non-fiction), style (photorealistic/illustrated), format (ebook/paperback/landscape)
- Each cover clickable to show the full series context

**Process Breakdowns**

- Blog posts or portfolio entries showing HOW the work was done
- "How I designed 12 consistent covers for a fantasy series"
- "How I planned a 5-book non-fiction series from a single topic"
- "How I created 30 character portraits with consistent style"
- These serve as both marketing AND SEO content

**Live Websites as Proof**

- aztec.ketanshukla.com
- repetition.ketanshukla.com
- reality.ketanshukla.com
- ketanshukla.com (the portfolio itself)
- Each one is a live demonstration of your web development capability

**Video Trailers**

- Once the HeyGen scripts are produced as actual videos, embed them on the site
- Video is the highest-converting content format for creative services

---

## Part 5: The Website Question

### Option A: Separate Business Website

Build a new site (e.g., bookseriesforge.com or similar) dedicated purely to the service business.

**Pros:**

- Clean separation between "author" and "service provider"
- Can be optimised purely for lead generation and conversion
- Different brand identity

**Cons:**

- Starts with zero credibility, zero SEO, zero traffic
- Duplicates effort — you'd be maintaining two sites
- Loses the most powerful asset: your actual published work as proof

### Option B: Extend ketanshukla.com (Recommended)

Add business/services sections to the existing author portfolio. The author site IS the proof. Keep everything under one roof.

**Pros:**

- Your existing work is immediately visible as portfolio evidence
- Single brand: Ketan Shukla = author + creator + service provider
- SEO compounds — blog posts, portfolio pages, and service pages all boost each other
- Prospects see the quality of your work before they even reach the services page
- One site to maintain, one GitHub repo, one deployment

**Cons:**

- Needs careful information architecture so author content and business content don't confuse each other
- Navigation needs to clearly separate "My Books" from "Services" from "Blog"

### Recommended Site Structure for ketanshukla.com

```
ketanshukla.com/
├── / (Home — hero + brief intro as author AND creator)
├── /series (Existing series showcase — Aztec, Repetition, Reality)
│   ├── /series/aztec
│   ├── /series/repetition
│   └── /series/reality
├── /services (NEW — service packages with pricing and CTAs)
│   ├── /services/book-covers
│   ├── /services/series-branding
│   ├── /services/series-planning
│   ├── /services/author-websites
│   ├── /services/video-scripts
│   └── /services/childrens-books
├── /portfolio (NEW — gallery of all visual work, case studies)
│   ├── /portfolio/covers
│   ├── /portfolio/characters
│   ├── /portfolio/websites
│   └── /portfolio/case-studies
├── /blog (NEW — process posts, tips, behind-the-scenes, SEO content)
├── /about (Author bio, expanded with professional credentials)
├── /contact (NEW — inquiry form for services)
└── /testimonials (NEW — as you get clients)
```

### Why This Works

A prospect arrives at ketanshukla.com. They see:

1. A professional, modern website (proof you can build them)
2. 22 published books with stunning covers (proof you can design them)
3. 3 complete series with cohesive branding (proof you can plan them)
4. 30 character portraits (proof you can create them)
5. Video trailers (proof you can script them)
6. A services page that says: "I can do all of this for you"

The entire site IS the sales pitch. Every page is a demonstration. That is dramatically more powerful than a standalone business site with stock photos and generic copy.

---

## Part 6: Marketing Channels

### Organic / SEO (Long-term, highest ROI)

- Blog posts: "How to plan a book series," "AI book cover design process," "Author website best practices"
- Each post targets a specific keyword that self-published authors search for
- Your existing series pages will rank for series-related terms
- Process breakdowns and tutorials establish authority

### Social Media

- **Twitter/X:** Share covers, process threads, behind-the-scenes
- **Instagram:** Cover gallery, character portraits, before/after reveals
- **YouTube:** Turn HeyGen scripts into actual videos. Behind-the-scenes content. Series planning walkthroughs
- **TikTok:** Short-form cover reveals, "watch me design a book cover in 60 seconds"
- **Reddit:** r/selfpublish, r/writing, r/bookcovers — provide genuine value, not spam

### Direct Outreach

- Self-publishing Facebook groups (massive market)
- Writing communities (NaNoWriMo, Scribophile, etc.)
- Fiverr/Upwork initially to build reviews and client base
- Author conferences and events (virtual and in-person)

### Email List

- Offer a free resource (e.g., "Series Planning Template" or "Book Cover Checklist") in exchange for email
- Nurture with process content and case studies
- Convert with service offers

---

## Part 7: Pricing Philosophy

### Don't Compete on Price

The market is full of cheap Fiverr covers ($20–$50) that look generic. Your differentiator is not price — it's the **complete pipeline and the quality of the output**. Position yourself as premium.

### Value-Based Pricing

- A single book cover might sell for $200, but if it makes the author's book look professional enough to convert browsers into buyers, the ROI for them is massive
- A complete series launch package at $5,000 is a fraction of what a traditional publisher would spend — and the author keeps all their rights
- An author website at $2,000 replaces a $200/month WordPress maintenance contract within 10 months

### Start with Portfolio-Building Rates

- First 5–10 clients: offer reduced rates in exchange for testimonials and permission to showcase the work
- Build the case study library
- Then move to full pricing

---

## Part 8: Immediate Next Steps

1. **Decide on site structure** — extend ketanshukla.com with services/portfolio/blog sections
2. **Create 3 case studies** from your existing series (Aztec, Repetition, Reality)
3. **Write 3 blog posts** demonstrating your process (cover design, series planning, website building)
4. **Set up a contact/inquiry form** with fields for project type and budget
5. **Create a services page** with clear packages and pricing (or "starting from" pricing)
6. **Produce the HeyGen videos** from the scripts you already have — embed on site
7. **List on Fiverr/Upwork** for initial client acquisition and reviews
8. **Start posting process content** on social media (covers, portraits, before/after)
9. **Build an email opt-in** with a free series planning template

---

## Part 9: What Makes This Business Defensible

The AI tools are available to everyone. What's NOT available to everyone is:

1. **The taste and judgment** to use them well — knowing what makes a good cover, a good series structure, a good website
2. **The complete pipeline** — most people can do one thing. You can do all of it, end to end
3. **The proof** — 22 published books, 3 live portfolio websites, dozens of professional covers. This is not a pitch deck. This is a track record.
4. **The systems** — prompt engineering, style headers, generation scripts, assembly pipelines. These are production systems, not experiments
5. **The speed** — because you've built the pipeline, you can deliver faster than someone figuring it out for the first time

That combination — taste + pipeline + proof + systems + speed — is the moat.

## Part 10: Updates & Revision Pricing

When a client comes back and asks for changes to work you've already delivered, that's billable work. Here's how to price updates and revisions for each package.

### Package 1: Book Cover Design

| Update Type                                                  | Price                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Minor tweaks (text fix, color adjustment, subtitle change)   | $25–$50 per revision |
| Major rework (new concept, different style, layout overhaul) | $75–$150             |
| Format conversion (e.g., ebook cover → paperback wrap)       | $50–$100             |

**Policy:** Include 1–2 rounds of minor revisions in the original price. Anything beyond that is billed separately. A "minor" revision is a text or color tweak. A "major" revision is a new concept or layout — essentially a new cover at a returning client discount.

### Package 2: Series Branding

| Update Type                                                              | Price                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New book cover matching existing series branding                         | $100–$250 per book (discounted from standalone — style guide already exists) |
| Logo or branding refresh                                                 | $150–$300                                                                    |
| New box set or panoramic cover for additional volumes                    | $100–$200                                                                    |
| Series Expansion retainer (ongoing cover additions as new books publish) | $200–$400/quarter                                                            |

**Policy:** Once the series visual identity is established, adding new books to it is faster because the style system already exists. Price accordingly — cheaper than a standalone cover, but still meaningful because consistency requires care.

### Package 3: Series Architecture & Planning

| Update Type                                                                                   | Price                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Adding books to an existing series plan (new outlines, chapter structure, continuity updates) | $100–$300 per book      |
| Restructuring an existing plan (reordering books, splitting/merging, arc changes)             | $200–$500               |
| Updated book descriptions for Amazon (e.g., after a rebrand or new edition)                   | $30–$50 per description |

**Policy:** This is the stickiest service. Once you've built a client's series architecture, they will come back to you for every expansion. Lean into this — it's long-term recurring work.

### Package 4: Author Portfolio Website

| Update Type                                                        | Price                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Content updates (adding a new book, updating bio, swapping covers) | $50–$100 per update, or $150–$300/month maintenance retainer |
| New page or section (e.g., new series page, events page)           | $200–$500                                                    |
| Design refresh (new theme, layout overhaul, new animations)        | $500–$1,500                                                  |
| Bug fixes / hosting issues (after 30-day free support window)      | $75–$150/hour                                                |

**Policy:** Push the maintenance retainer model. Authors publish new books regularly and will need the site updated. A $200/month retainer for unlimited minor updates is attractive to clients and gives you predictable recurring revenue. Include 30 days of free post-launch support in the original price.

### Package 5: Marketing Video Scripts

| Update Type                                                                      | Price                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Script revision (new narration, updated scene direction)                         | $75–$150                                    |
| New script for a new book in the same series (reusing established tone/style)    | $150–$350 (slight discount from standalone) |
| Adapting script to a different format (e.g., 3-min trailer → 60-sec social clip) | $50–$100                                    |

**Policy:** Bundle with cover design. When a client publishes a new book, offer a "New Book Launch Pack" (cover + script) at a combined rate — this increases average order value.

### Package 6: Children's Picture Book

| Update Type                                    | Price                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text/story edits with re-illustrated pages     | $30–$75 per page                                                  |
| Adding new pages to an existing book           | $50–$100 per new illustrated page                                 |
| New character or scene in existing style       | $75–$150                                                          |
| Full sequel book (same characters, same style) | $600–$2,000 (discounted — character design system already exists) |

**Policy:** Character consistency is the hard part. Once it's nailed for book 1, sequels are faster to produce. Price sequels lower than the original, but don't undervalue the work — maintaining consistency across a full book still requires significant effort.

### Package 7: Full Pipeline / Premium

| Update Type                                                                              | Price                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Ongoing retainer (website maintenance + new covers + updated descriptions + new scripts) | $500–$1,500/month    |
| Per-book expansion (cover + description + website update + script for each new book)     | $500–$1,000 per book |
| Annual refresh (new covers, website redesign, updated branding)                          | $1,000–$2,500        |

**Policy:** This is your highest-value client. Lock them into an annual retainer. They are outsourcing their entire publishing production pipeline to you — price it as the premium, irreplaceable service it is.

### General Revision Policy

1. **Always include 1–2 revision rounds in the base price** — this builds trust and avoids nickel-and-diming on the initial delivery
2. **Define "minor" vs "major" clearly in your contract** — minor = text/color tweaks; major = new concept/layout/structure
3. **Retainers over one-off charges** — recurring revenue is the goal. Website maintenance and series expansion retainers are the most natural fits
4. **Returning client discount** — offer 10–15% off for repeat clients. They're already sold on your quality; make it easy and rewarding to come back
5. **Rush fees** — charge 25–50% extra for turnarounds under 48 hours. Your time and pipeline efficiency have value
6. **Scope creep protection** — always agree on the scope of an update in writing before starting. "Can you just..." requests are the biggest source of unpaid work

---

## Summary

- **Sell the complete pipeline**, not individual assets
- **Use your existing work as proof** — it's the most powerful marketing you have
- **Extend ketanshukla.com** rather than building a separate site — the author portfolio IS the business portfolio
- **Add services, portfolio gallery, blog, and contact sections** to the existing site
- **Price premium**, not cheap — your differentiator is quality and completeness
- **Market through content** — blog posts, social media, and video that demonstrate your process
- **Start with portfolio-building clients** to get testimonials, then scale pricing

The foundation is already built. The next step is to restructure the website to serve both purposes — author showcase AND service business — and start putting the work in front of the people who need it.
