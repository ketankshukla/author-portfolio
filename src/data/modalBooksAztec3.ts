    elaborateDescription: "Skyren takes center stage as the alliance's aerial operations become critical. Riding her hawk Cielovar, she coordinates reconnaissance and evacuation across the war-torn continent. Meanwhile, Miyako — the exile sensei who taught Kaelen the shadow-step — descends into Helisar's factory city to destroy his ash-oath production from within. Neyla pushes her healing abilities to their limits reversing mass ash-oaths. Helisar is fascinated by Neyla's power and attempts to study her. Miyako's infiltration succeeds, but at a terrible cost: she makes her final stand to protect the team's escape, fulfilling her redemption arc from exile to hero. Her death galvanizes the alliance. As the army mobilizes for the march south, Korvain and Miyako share one last conversation about duty and sacrifice.",

    elaborateDescription: "The darkest book of the saga. Racing south to reach an ancient temple that holds the Sunheart — a relic that could turn the war — Itzil confronts Nightshade in a brutal duel. The assassin uses a dark ritual to corrupt the Sun-Blade's light, and the weapon shatters in Itzil's hands. Without her blade, Itzil fights with nothing but her fists and her will. In the aftermath, Korvain — wounded, declining, but still teaching — speaks his last words and dies peacefully in Itzil's arms. This is rock bottom. The blade is broken, the mentor is gone, the army is demoralized. Kaelen's words pierce the darkness: 'You don't need a blade to be who you are.' Solkren notices something in the shattered fragments. Valdremor broadcasts a message offering merciful surrender. The army must decide. Itzil makes a promise at Korvain's pyre: they will march to the Dominion capital and end this war.",
