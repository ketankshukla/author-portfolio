    elaborateDescription: "When Dominion soldiers raid her village and steal the Ember Core — one of seven sacred relics — Itzil, a young warrior-in-training at the Sun-Blade temple, is thrust into a prophecy she doesn't want. Trained by the aging grandmaster Korvain, she must learn to manifest the Sun-Blade, a weapon forged from pure sunlight and conviction. Gathering allies — the cocky scout Kaelen, the glory-seeking duelist Jagren, the quiet engineer Torvane, and the compassionate healer Neyla — Itzil leads her first strike against a Dominion outpost and comes face to face with Nightshade, a blood-magic assassin who offers her a deal she refuses. As Volzentar deploys his beast commander Gravok, the horizon darkens with the shadow of an army that will test everything Itzil believes about leadership, courage, and sacrifice.",

Itzil defeats and captures Gravok, choosing mercy over execution. But in the aftermath, Amalura examines the anchor fragments and goes pale: these devices are older than the Dominion. The enemy is collecting parts to rebuild the Great Gate — a sealed portal to something terrible. A captured officer whispers a name that chills the blood: Serenthar, the Weeping One.",

At the Grand Summit of neutral nations, Zariel needs proof of Dominion atrocities: a freed ash-oath slave to testify. While he works the political arena, Itzil leads a strike against Helisar's 'sanctuary' — actually an ash-oath factory run by a fallen saint whose gentle kindness masks utter monstrosity. The freed slave's testimony devastates Pearlvaine's position, but the demon-diplomat pivots: she holds Zariel's younger sister hostage. Zariel makes the hardest choice of his life — the alliance over his sister's safety. Kaelen's rescue mission succeeds. Three of five neutral nations join the alliance. But Volzentar has been watching through a spy, and he knows every detail of their plans.",
