    elaborateDescription: "The allied army's offensive against Fortress Ashfall goes too well — because it's a trap. Nightshade seals the retreat with blood-wards. The Ashvanar brothers unleash dark magic. Hundreds die. Jagren, who dreamed of glory, leads a desperate breakout and kills one of the Ashvanar brothers in a brutal duel — the first villain killed. He nearly dies himself, saved only by Neyla's healing. Volzentar arrives in person, offering 'merciful surrender' with terrifyingly logical arguments. Itzil refuses. Serenthar makes her first physical appearance — she predicted the battle's outcome before it began. Torvane engineers a controlled explosion and Skyren provides aerial evacuation, but the alliance loses a third of its army. Two neutral nations are conquered while the heroes were trapped. The boy who wanted glory found horror instead.",

    elaborateDescription: "Act II opens with Valdremor — the Architect — taking personal command of Dominion operations. Where Volzentar ruled by charisma and force, Valdremor operates through cold logic and precise strategy. He dispatches forces to seize the fifth relic at Relicara, a sacred cathedral. Kaelen leads the infiltration team while Itzil's forces create a diversion. Rainara, a water-magic wielder freed from Dominion captivity, joins the team and proves devastatingly effective. But Valdremor anticipated every move. The relic is taken by Dominion forces in a surgical strike that makes the heroes' diversion irrelevant. Solkren, a master armorer, begins forging weapons capable of countering Dominion magic. The alliance strengthens even as the enemy coils tighter.",

Miyako resolves to fight rather than hide. As the groups struggle to reunite, Helisar expands his ash-oath operations and Serenthar whispers through Amalura's dreams. The long dark has begun.",
